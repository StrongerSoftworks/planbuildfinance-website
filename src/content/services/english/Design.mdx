We offer an entire host of design services for all of your residential and multi-family design project goals. Our services are especially well catered towards additions, decks, interior renovations, secondary dwelling units including both attached and detached, new home builds, real estate investment projects, duplexes, triplex, fourplexes and multi-family construction projects.

Our approach is an integrated approach which includes financing, permitting, budgeting and scheduling. We leverage these key pre-construction fundamental principles to reduce our clients risk on their real estate construction projects. At a secondary capacity we also offer our assistance throughout the project as needed to ensure construction moves fluently from start to finish this includes constructability reviews, inspection assistance, material sourcing, contractor referrals, and any other service our clients may require within reason.

We provide a turn-key zoning, planning and permitting service which includes coordination of all required design and engineering professionals necessary to obtain the building permit to start work. We submit the project to the City on the owners behalf and provide ongoing support until the issuance of the permit by Municipality or County having jurisdiction.

## Planning

Prior to starting a construction project it's important to create a plan and ensure the project will achieve the desired outcome. We typically break down the plan into a few key pieces which can then be broken down into further pieces. Having a good structure is essential to staying organized and not losing track of the principal reasons behind the project and the key goals behind the project. The goals behind your specific project can be as simple as a new deck to relax on to as complex as a real estate portfolio spanning 1000s of units across the Country and beyond. We are exceptionally well qualified and stand out among others due to our experience in finance, lending and construction. It provides us with the necessary experience to simplify complex problems and provide a hands-on catered solution to your specific project.

## Budget & Cost Control

When review a project clients typically want to have an idea on the final cost of their project. A builder is often a great resource to provide a budget on your project. However Plan Build Finance is also capable of providing project budgets tailored specifically to the projects design. In addition to the cost of the project we also provide anticipated revenues associated to your project necessary for determining return on investment (ROI) and cashflow. If your project is large enough an appraisal can also be ordered based on design to determine future building value upon completion.

Our budgets are based on industry pricing of materials, equipment and labour necessary to complete the work. They are broken down into the various divisions of the Master Format and include soft costs associated to financing, utilities, permits, design, contingencies, ect necessary to complete the entire project from inception through to completion.

Often times our budgets can be reinforced through subcontractor and supplier quotations for your specific project to provide a greater level of certainty and reduce risk to the project.
Plan Build Finance has in depth knowledge of standard construction contracts and simplified purchase orders and can support the home owner or developer through the contractual negotiation phase with subtrades and general contractors alike. Our knowledge in this sector is vast and ranges across many of the standard contract prepared by the Canadian Construction Association. We can also provide insight and connections to insurers for larger projects requiring wrap-up liability and builders risk insurance policies.

## Scheduling

Scheduling marks another key planning element necessary to review to ensure the project aligns with the projects goals. A projects schedule has a direct impact on the overall cost and a longer project schedule can often lead to increased costs associated to financing. The schedule needs to be reviewed in accordance with the design and budget.

When we prepare a schedule we take a high-level approach and review the primary tasks necessary to complete the project from start to finish. We leverage our experience and review all long lead materials and provide our owners with this critical information and advise our owners which materials should be ordered first. We also analyze the different scopes of work and make recommendations on which tasks should be completed before other tasks to ensure your project site is running as efficiently as possible.
