  about_founder:
    "Benjamin Thompson founded Plan Build Finance Inc. in 2024 after growing a real estate portfolio of 17 units across Southwestern Ontario and managing the construction of over $500,000,000 of residential, industrial, institutional and commercial projects across North America. With his experience and passion for all things construction and finance he brings unmatched potential to his clients and seeks to improve their well being and the local communities we live in.
    <br /><br />
    Ben grew up in London, Ontario and attended Fanshawe College for Architectural Technology. While working in Ottawa on a Co-op work term he studied after hours and on weekends and obtained his design license for Small Buildings. After graduation in 2011 he relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia and started his career with a smaller local General Contractor in an estimating and management role. While working for KDS Construction Ltd. he continued his studies and became qualified as a Professional Quantity Surveyor with the Canadian Institute of Quantity Surveyors. While in British Columbia he worked on many institutional and educational projects including many prison, hospital and university renovation projects and the conversion of a newsprint factory into a modern day film studio.
    <br /><br />
    After three years in British Columbia and a brief break from the profession Ben returned back to his hometown of London, Ontario where he continued his work with a larger general contractor. Ben became responsible for the finances, management, design and permitting of large scale industrial projects across Ontario. Shortly after his return he became Gold Seal Certified with the Canadian Construction Association and started building his own real estate investment portfolio. Leveraging all of his skills he was able to successfully design, build, and finance 17 of his own rental units including two of the first Accessory Dwelling Units in both London, Ontario and Sarnia, Ontario. With a background in construction design and finance it complemented the expansion into the residential and commercial lending sectors and Plan Build FInance Inc. was born.
    <br /><br />
    Today Ben focuses on bringing together his 15 years and over $500,000,000 of experience in the construction, design and finance sectors together under one brand to breed a new well informed and strategic home owner and investor.
    <br /><br />
    Ben takes a relaxed common-sense approach to all of his projects. When he isnâ€™t focused mentally on how to construct and deconstruct a project he can usually be found on long walks with his partner Katie, hiking in nature, exploring the world or enjoying a cold pint with friends."
