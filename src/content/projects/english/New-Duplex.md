Construction of a single storey, 2,200sf duplex house on a helical pile foundation. The house features two independent units and a total of five bedrooms, three bathrooms, two kitchens, two living rooms, two laundry rooms and large decks, one being covered. This project involved the demolition and removal of an existing house and construction of this new house.

## Cost

$330,000.00

Utilizing a helical pile foundation allowed us to keep costs down and avoid ground disturbance.

## Schedule

Four months - not including design and permitting.

The schedule for this house was smooth without interruption.

## Challenges

Challenges were limited on this project. A well detailed plan was created prior to start of the project and it was followed through to completion.

## What stands out

- Large open kitchen and living spaces
- Conversational outdoor decks
- Plenty of parking
