Construction of a 700sf, single storey, accessory dwelling unit in the rear yard of an existing house. The house was built on a traditional 4’-0” deep concrete foundation and features two bedrooms, one bathroom, in-suite laundry, kitchen, living room and large concrete patio. Large windows and warm colours create a comfortable living environment.

## Cost

$160,000.00

Construction costs for this house were slightly higher due to earthwork and foundation costs associated to the traditional foundation. Including the need to create a temporary access road to complete construction.

## Schedule

Four months - not including design and permitting.

The schedule for this build took an extra month due to poor weather conditions and difficult site access.

## Challenges

Access to the build created challenges. We experienced heavy rainfall and muddy conditions on site throughout the build.

Utilizing a traditional foundation meant de-watering and protection of the ground throughout the foundation pour.

This was the first, or one the first accessory dwelling units built in the City of Sarnia. It was built prior to the establishment of current legislation and therefore required a more rigorous approval and permitting process.

## What stands out

- Excellent secondary living space on the property
- One floor living permitting more accessible living
