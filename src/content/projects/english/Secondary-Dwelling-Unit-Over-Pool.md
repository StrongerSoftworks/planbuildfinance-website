Construction of an 800sf, single storey, Secondary Dwelling unit attached to the rear of the main house. This home was built on concrete piers overtop of an old inground swimming pool. The home features two bedrooms, one bathroom, in-suite laundry, kitchen, living room and patio. Large windows facing the rear yard allows for plenty of sunlight to reach throughout the home along with light warm colours creating a warm and inviting space.

## Cost

$120,000.00

The construction cost for this home permitted a lot of value on the property. Costs were kept to a minimum due to the style of foundation and ability to tie the services together with the primary house without having to excavate.

## Schedule

Three months - not including design and permitting.

## Challenges

Construction over an existing in-ground swimming pool required construction sequencing and techniques to ensure a stable foundation due to the unique site condition.

Tie-ins to the existing home required close attention to detail to ensure a watertight seal and roof and exterior walls.

## What stands out

- Large windows overlooking yard
- Excellent acoustics due to masonry construction separating the addition
- Good use of space building overtop of an old swimming pool
