Construction of a 700sf, single storey, detached home in the backyard of the main house. The house was built on concrete sonotubes, with wood beams and conventional 2x framing. The home features two bedrooms, one bathroom, in-suite laundry, kitchen, living room and a large vaulted covered deck overlooking open green space. In addition to the home parking areas were restored on the site. Services were trenched in from the main house including gas, electricity, water, sewer and communications.

## Cost

$160,000.00

Construction costs were slightly higher than average due to the site works costs associated to bringing in services and the driveway work.

## Schedule

Three months - not including design and permitting.

## Challenges

Plan Build Finance built this house prior to current legislation imposed by the Province of Ontario and therefore the approvals associated to the permit were lengthy. This was the first or one of the first Accessory Dwelling Units built in London, ON and went through a full Site Plan Approval process which involved many studies, reports, inspections and approvals. The province has implemented new legislation which makes it far easier to build these projects now and we typically have permits in around four weeks from time of submission.

## What stands out

- Beautiful site, large open landscape space with lots of parking
- Large vaulted covered deck
- Big windows permitting natural light
